Challenged by SoC. Challenge accepted!

--- Day 1 ---  
 2024-10-17

After recently completing my pre-course bootcamp material for SoC, I've discovered that I'm not that confident with CSS.
So today I focused on the materials on The Odin Project, learning about Flexbox.

I wanted to improve my knowledge by starting to go through the exercises for flex under the foundations folder within the css-exercises provided.
Today I completed exercises _01-flex-center_ & _02-flex-header_.

I struggled a bit with the 2nd exercise; I did a fair amount of trial and erroring many flex options inside different containers, and using the DevTools to inspect to try and figure out what styles were being used or overwritten.

Continuation of the flex exercises from the css-exercises from The Odin Project; _03-flex-header-2_ and _04-flex-information_.

The first exercise went well however the second one took a considerable amount of time - just when I thought I got a better grasp of grouping containers I had a bit of trouble aligning the text appropriately under each image item. 
It took me a while to realise I needed to make seperate containers for each item and text, and then justifying those into columns themselves.

 Today I wanted to divide my time; begin with a little css practice, and move onto continuing my python coding journey to improve my logic and algorithm thinking!

 Started with another flex css-exercise from The Odin Project, _05-flex-modal_. I spent time planning the containers & row/column divides I would need for this to work. 
 This has been the first time since using CSS where I felt like I was inputting style with intent, rather than almost pure trial and error.

 Ended the day with a revisit to an old quiz terminal app I had created a couple of months ago (kudos to Angela Yu's python course on Udemy).
 Until today, the questions were hard coded into a separate file saved locally. I am now using an API call request to the Open Trivia DB site to grab a random set of 10 boolean questions to print and answer inside the console.

 However, there was a small issue present as the HTML escape entities were also being printed within the questions, so I needed to import the html module and utilise the unescape function so the characters are translated back to their original form.
