Challenged by SoC. Challenge accepted!

--- Day 1 ---
 2024-10-17

After recently completing my pre-course bootcamp material for SoC, I've discovered that I'm not that confident with CSS.
So today I focused on the materials on the Odin-project, learning about Flexbox.

I tested my knowledge by starting to go through the exercises for flex under the foundations folder within the css exercises provided.
Today I completed exercises _01-flex-center_ & _02-flex-header_
