# -100DaysOfCode_Challenge
Challenged by SoC. Challenge accepted!

--- Day 1 ---
 2024-10-17

After recently completing my pre-course bootcamp material for SoC, I've discovered that I'm not that confident with CSS.
So today I focused on the materials on The Odin Project, learning about Flexbox.

I tested my knowledge by starting to go through the exercises for flex under the foundations folder within the css-exercises provided.
Today I completed exercises _01-flex-center_ & _02-flex-header_.

I struggled a bit with the 2nd exercise; I did a fair amount of trial and erroring many flex options inside different containers, and using the DevTools to inspect to try and figure out what styles were being used or overwritten.

 Continuation of the flex exercises from the css-exercises from The Odin Project; _03-flex-header-2_ and _04-flex-information_.

The first exercise went well however the second one took a considerable amount of time - just when I thought I got a better grasp of grouping containers I had a bit of trouble aligning the text appropriately under each image item. It took me a while to realise I needed to make seperate containers for each item and text, and then justifying those into columns themselves.
